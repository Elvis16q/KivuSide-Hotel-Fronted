Online Hotel Booking System Abstract
=======================================
Online bookings and reservations have seen exponential growth in the last few years. Everything from booking tickets to venues is done online.
An online hotel booking system will make sure users are able to find suitable places instead of wandering places to find a better place for accommodation one can book it online at their convenience.

So, we on Codebun have developed an Online Hotel Booking System Project in spring boot and hibernate for users to book Online Hotels online.
Here, this application supports majorly two roles i.e. Admin and User. Admin will add, and remove Online Hotels. And users can view Online Hotels and book them.

Admin is the primary user. Admin can Add/Remove/Update any details related to the system, update booking charges of the place, View/Confirm/Cancel booking orders placed by Users, and so on.

Users can register themselves and then do the booking, make payments online for advance bookings, etc.
Users can find detailed information about the Hotels & packages on the system after logging in.

The following are the major objective of this application:
===========================================================
To provide a bug-free application to the admin and user.
The main objective is to build a secured, robust Online Hotel Booking System Project where the information on booking is managed properly.
It maintains the record of Online Hotels, and the user booking detail efficiently so that it would be easy to access at any time 24*7.
